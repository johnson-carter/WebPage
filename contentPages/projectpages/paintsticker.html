            <h3>For Everyone</h3>
            <p>PaintSticker is designed from the ground up with 3 key principles in mind:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Accessibility: The user interface is intuitive and easy to navigate, making it suitable for both beginners and experienced users. Beyond that, PaintSticker is open source. This means anyone can download the source files and run them anywhere, anytime.</li>
                <li>Privacy: PaintSticker knocks it out of the park when it comes to privacy. No user data is ever stored by PaintSticker. All operations take place on your device, and the program does not rely on external dependencies.</li>
                <li>Performace: Lightweight execution means less memory used by PaintSticker and more memory that can be used by your main project. This makes PaintSticker a great companion tool.</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>This sounds great! Where can I get it?</h4>
